<p style="font-size: 35px;">    ✹ The "Fuck Off" Web Manifesto ✹ </p>
<p>

Ten rules I wrote for myself, to remember why I build this website, and who it's for.  <br><br><br>

1. Effort Is the Gate, Not the Wall  <br><br>
If someone won't bother to read it, they don't need to understand.  <br>
If they can't paste an RSS link, they don't need updates.  <br>
If they won't write an email, their comment can wait.  <br>
This isn't a product. It's scribbles on my walls - <br>
come closer only if it matters to you.  <br><br><br>

2. No One Is Watching, And That's the Point  <br><br>
I won't track. I won't analyze. I won't optimize.  <br>
You're anonymous here, just like everyone else.  <br>
If you're here, I hope it's because you found your way - <br>
not because you were pushed.  <br><br><br>

3. Looks Don't Matter (But Soul Does)  <br><br>
I don't need slick graphics, dark mode, retina support.  <br>
If it's readable, it's enough.  <br>
I write each and every line of HTML with my own hands.  <br>
I write with what I have and I leave the rest behind.  <br>
If I made it, it's beautiful. For me. <br><br><br>

4. Uptime Doesn't Matter  <br><br>
This site may go down.  <br>
That's okay.  <br>
Maybe the solar panel fails. Maybe the server dies.  <br>
That only proves it's real.  <br>
If I bring it back, it's because I care -  <br>
and if you come back, then maybe you do too.  <br><br><br>

5. The Web Is Not a Business  <br><br>
I'm not here to "serve content."  <br>
I write because I want to, not because I'm supposed to.  <br>
There is no target audience.  <br>
This is a space, not a service.  <br><br><br>

6. Dynamic Is Dead  <br><br>
I choose .html, .txt, raw files and rough edges.  <br>
No bloated frameworks. No needless scripts.  <br>
Every byte should carry meaning.  <br><br><br>

7. No One Gets to Own This  <br><br>
You can copy this. Mirror it. Print it. Archive it.  <br>
I don't believe in digital scarcity.  <br>
What's worth writing is worth keeping.  <br>
I might die today, but the internet should be forever.  <br><br><br>

8. Write Like It's a Letter  <br><br>
This isn't content. This is a message in a bottle.  <br>
Maybe to myself. Maybe to someone I'll never meet.  <br>
No hashtags. No SEO. Just words that needed to happen.  <br><br><br>

9. Build for the Few Who Get It  <br><br>
I don't need followers.  <br>
I don't need "engagement." <br> 
If two people find this in the dark and feel less alone - that's enough.  <br>
If no one does, it still mattered, because I needed to say it.  <br><br><br>

10. Labour Is Love  <br><br>
I build this by hand, because that's the only way it feels like mine.  <br>
I don't outsource the soul.  <br>
I don't outsource anything.  <br>
If it's ugly, it's honest.  <br>
If it's broken, I'll fix it - or leave it broken.  <br>
Either way, I'll love it, because it cost me effort -  <br>
and effort is love.  <br><br><br>

I don't owe the internet polish. <br>  
I don't owe the algorithm compliance. <br>  
This isn't a product.  <br>
This is my corner of the world - <br>
and it will be the way I choose. <br><br><br>
