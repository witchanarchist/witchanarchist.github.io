Hey! After sitting on this domain for what? 3 months? I decided to do something with it. Here is this thing! For now it's small but it may get bigger. Maybe. On the top there will be some images, down here - some text posts. About what? Posts - about any bright or not so bright thoughts from depths of my synapses. Images? Who knows really. Expect pseudo-inspired naive art and scans from typewriter. In the meantime... maybe look at the pretty background? Or look up Tartan on Wikipedia. Its surprisingly long. Or go to <a href="https://mcnostril.com/">mcnostril.com</a> and look at some actually creative stuff. Anyway have fun! <br>
P.S. Uh Soo Domain is still NOT up... I either got ripped off, or web demons hate me. I would say it's 50/50 one or the other.
